# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 01, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Hamburg Menu Icon

**Thoughts:** This is first day of the year and I wanted to start the #100DaysOfCode challenge. For that I am starting with a very lightweight project. It's just used HTML5 anc CSS3 for cool menu icon animation.
