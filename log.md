# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 01, 2020

**Today's Project**: hamburger Menu Icon

**Thoughts:** This is first day of the year and I wanted to start the #100DaysOfCode challenge. For that I am starting with a very lightweight project. It's just used HTML5 anc CSS3 for cool menu icon animation.
